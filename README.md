sublime-text-2-settings
=======================

These are my settings for Sublime Text 2

To use these setting in place of existing settings, paste the following line into the terminal:

mv -f-r ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/ ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2-backup/

This will rename your existing setting folder to Sublime Text 2-backup

You can now paste the following like into the command line:

git clone https://github.com/IAMRYO/sublime-text-2-settings.git ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/

this will pull in all the settings from this repo.
